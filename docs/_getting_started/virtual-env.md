The `venv` module included with Python is used to create and manage virtual environments.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named `myenv` within the current folder
$ python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
$ source myenv/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
$ deactivate
```
